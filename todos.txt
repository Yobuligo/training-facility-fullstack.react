- User Management
	- Joined on must be changeable in admin mode
	- Current user must not be deactivatable
	# Deletion of current user must not be possible
	# UserBankAccount must be loaded with User
- Login
	- Deactivated user must not be logged in
	
	
Best Practices Sequelize:
- related objects must be optional in entity interfaces (e.g. IUser has IUserProfile)
